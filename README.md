## Description
"Classics with Cats" is a web application that provides a safe chat room and search engine for young girls. This application was made for girls ages 9-13 who are searching for new books to read and a way to connect with other girls who share a passion for literature.

Some of the technologies we used are Handlebars.js, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and Animate.css.

  When you click on the book cover image, you will be taken to a more detailed exploration of that book, including summary, author, and comments from other "cats".

  You can login with a username and a password to unlock even more features. An active user is able to add books to the digital library and comment on different titles. They can interact with the application in a meaningful way.
